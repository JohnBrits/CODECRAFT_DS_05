# Traffic Accident Analysis using Power Bi
Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of traffic accidents using Power BI. The dashboard presents key insights into accident trends, locations, severity, contributing factors, and time-based patterns to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions for improving road safety.

Objectives

Identify accident-prone areas and trends.

Analyze accident severity and contributing factors.

Understand time-based patterns of accidents.

Provide visual insights for decision-making and policy implementation.
